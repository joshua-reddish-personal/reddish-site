Title: Python Movie Analytics with ChatGPT

Prompt:

I'm working on a Python application that analyzes a dataset of standardized JSON files, each representing a movie. The dataset includes information such as movie title, director, release year, genres, top actors, and criteria grades.

I need assistance with refining and optimizing my Python code to perform various analytics tasks. Here are the key functionalities I'm looking to implement:

Identify the most frequent release year in the dataset.
Calculate the median release year across the entire dataset.
Determine the top 10 favorite actors based on overall movie grade and frequency of appearance.
Identify the top 10 directors based on overall movie grade and frequency of appearance.
For each unique genre found in the dataset, list the top 3 movies in that genre based on emotional impact.
Determine the top 3 genres based on their frequency in the dataset.
Suggest a random movie where the 'graded' field is set to false.
Suggest a random movie where the 'criteria_graded' field is set to false.
The dataset is stored as standardized JSON files in a directory. Please ensure that the code handles potential missing keys gracefully.

Feel free to optimize the provided code and offer any improvements or suggestions. Thanks in advance for your help!

Example JSON Structure:

```json
{
  "media_type": "movie",
  "graded": true,
  "criteria_graded": false,
  "media_data": {
    "title": "Movie Title",
    "director": "Director Name",
    "release_year": 2022,
    "genres": ["Genre1", "Genre2"],
    "top_billed_actors": ["Actor1", "Actor2"],
    "criteria_grades": {"Emotional Impact": 5},
    "notes": "Additional notes"
  }
}
```
Instructions:

Optimize the provided code for efficiency and robustness.
Implement the specified functionalities.
Ensure the code gracefully handles potential missing keys in the JSON data.
Provide explanations for any significant changes or optimizations made.
Test the code with a sample dataset to verify its correctness.
Thanks for your assistance!
