        "notes": "Simply put, the best tv show I have ever watched. I don't really think I can put into words what makes it so great, but I get the sense watching it that I have the privledge of experiencing one of humanities' greatest cinematic accomplishments. The attention to detail is astounding, the story is both primal and incredibly complex. Visually every scene leverages the camera and the viewers perspective to envelop the story, creating an effect I struggle to describe. The acting from top to bottom is consistently best in class."
