I was introduced to these books as a young man, and I vividly remember by brother and father having many discussions about their favorite characters during road trips. Ive finished the first half of the series three times, the most recently on a road trip with my wife. The story is timeless, especially with the context of its publication date. The characters are excellent, and Zelazny's ability to describe his worlds leaves me feeling like im in a vivid fever dream. "
