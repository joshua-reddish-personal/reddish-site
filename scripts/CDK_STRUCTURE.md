To kickstart your AWS CDK project, first ensure you have AWS CDK installed. If not, you can install it by running `npm install -g aws-cdk`.

Let's design a basic folder structure for your CDK app. This structure will organize your resources such as DynamoDB table, CloudFront distribution, S3 bucket, and an API Gateway with a Lambda function for the backend logic.

### Recommended Folder Structure

```
project-root/
│
├── bin/
│   └── app.py          # Your app's entry point
│
├── lib/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── dynamodb_table_stack.py    # Stack for DynamoDB table
│   ├── cloudfront_s3_stack.py     # Stack for CloudFront and S3
│   └── apigateway_lambda_stack.py # Stack for API Gateway and Lambda
│
├── layers/             # Optional: for Lambda layers if needed
│
├── lambdas/            # Lambda function code
│   └── backend/
│       └── handler.py
│
└── app.py              # Main CDK app, where stacks are initiated
```

This is a suggested structure that helps keep your CDK project organized as it grows. Each stack has its own Python file for better modularity and maintenance.

### CDK Script for a DynamoDB Table

We will focus on the `lib/dynamodb_table_stack.py` part, which creates a DynamoDB table. Ensure you have AWS CDK and the necessary AWS CDK Python libraries installed in your environment.

#### Step 1: Initialize your CDK Project

If you haven't already, initialize your CDK project by running:

```bash
cdk init app --language python
```

#### Step 2: Install Required AWS CDK Modules

Make sure you are in your project directory, then install the necessary modules for DynamoDB by running:

```bash
pip install aws-cdk-lib constructs
```

#### Step 3: Create the DynamoDB Table Stack

Edit the `lib/dynamodb_table_stack.py` with the following code:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_dynamodb as ddb,
)
from constructs import Construct

class DynamodbTableStack(Stack):

    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        # Create a DynamoDB table
        ddb.Table(
            self, "MyTable",
            partition_key=ddb.Attribute(
                name="id",
                type=ddb.AttributeType.STRING
            ),
            billing_mode=ddb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
            removal_policy=cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,  # NOT recommended for production code
        )
```

#### Step 4: Include the Stack in Your CDK App

Edit the main `app.py` file to include your new `DynamodbTableStack`. Ensure to adjust the import statement based on your actual file path.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from aws_cdk import App
from lib.dynamodb_table_stack import DynamodbTableStack

app = App()
DynamodbTableStack(app, "DynamodbTableStack")

app.synth()
```

With this setup, you have a modular CDK project structure and a script ready to deploy a DynamoDB table.

### To Deploy

Run the following command in your project root directory:

```bash
cdk deploy DynamodbTableStack
```

This will orchestrate the deployment of your DynamoDB table as specified in the `dynamodb_table_stack.py` file.

Remember, AWS CDK scripts are a powerful way to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. The project structure and scripts in this guide are just starting points. As your project grows, you may find the need to adjust and expand based on your specific requirements.
