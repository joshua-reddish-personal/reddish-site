I never felt like it was moving too fast, as it always took time to breath life into the setting. The characters are incredibly well developed, and I love that there isn't really a central character. They all have plenty of time in the sun. Visually it is some of my favorite animation i've had the please of watching. I don't watch a ton of animated content, but this felt a step above."
