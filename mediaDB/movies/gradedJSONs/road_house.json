    "notes": "A truly timeless masterpiece. Incredibly quotable, with fun characters that keep your eyes glues to the screen. It's a movie that makes me wish there was a seedy bar from the 80's to go try my luck in. Great takeaways from Daltons character abound. It is refreshing to see characters that are capable from the start, there is no need to try a tune Dalton down. He is the best there is."
