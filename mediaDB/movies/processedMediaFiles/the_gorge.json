        "notes": "A fun and well paced movie that blended romance and action very well! The story was strong, and I liked that it was concise, without hinting at there being more we aren't told. Its characters are fun, intriguing, and well acted. Visually it was very high quality. The only miss for me was not delving into the apparent intelligence of the creatures in the gorge, it felt like a missed opportunity to expand on the story. "
